    <h2 align="center">History</h2>
    <p>
       Balayesu Vidyalaya is one of the best and well-known institutions in the Archdiocese of Bengaluru, Karnataka. The founder of this school was Rev. Fr. Balaiah, the former parish priest of Infant Jesus Church & Shrine in Viveknagar, Bengaluru. He was a pioneer in transforming the Infant Jesus Church into an Infant Jesus Shrine during the years 1979-1986.

With the aim of educating the economically weaker sections in Viveknagar, an area that was downtrodden, the school emerged as a single class with 82 students in the Kannada medium and 53 in the English medium. Mid-day meal programs helped to retain the strength of this institution.

From 1983 onwards, the classes were extended to the high school section. This led to simultaneous growth in three directions: the Nursery, Primary, and High School. The Christian Children Fund (CCF) was founded in 1983 to provide education to students who were unable to pay their school fees.

On 7th September 1993, a new school building was constructed and inaugurated by the then Chief Minister of Karnataka, Shri. Rama Krishna Hegde. The inauguration was blessed by the former Archbishop of Bengaluru, Most Rev. Dr. Arogyaswamy. After this, Balayesu Vidyalaya became a permanently recognized unaided institution under the Archdiocese's Board of Education, with the Archbishop Most Rev. Dr. Alphonsus Mathias as the patron.

Thanks to the foundational efforts of Rev. Fr. Balaiah as the founder of this institution, and the contributions of all who served and enlightened this institution—especially all the Presidents of ABE, Secretaries of ABE, Managers, Correspondents, Principals, H.Ms, and finally, the staff and non-teaching staff for their selfless service—the school has continued to thrive. Special thanks go to the students who are the heart of the school.

May Infant Jesus bless us as He said, "The more you honor me, the more I will bless you." Finally, I seek God’s blessings upon us all.<br><br>

Your Brother in Christ,<br><br>
