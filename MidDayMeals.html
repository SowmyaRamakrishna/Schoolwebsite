            <h2>Nutritious Mid-Day Meals</h2>
            <p>Mid-day meal is a program launched by the Balayesu Vidyalaya with
                the aim of providing free meals to poor school children in our school. The
                program was started in 1983, and since then, it has been successful in
                increasing enrolment and attendance in school. The mid-day meal program is important for several reasons:
                Nutrition: The mid-day meal provides a nutritious meal to children, which helps in their physical and cognitive development. Many children come from economically weaker sections of society and may not get adequate nutrition at home. The mid-day meal ensures that they get at least one nutritious meal a day.
                Education: Hunger can be a major obstacle to learning. Children who are hungry are less likely to attend school and concentrate on their studies. The mid-day meal ensures that children are well-fed and can focus on their studies.
                Health: The mid-day meal program also helps in reducing mal nutrition among children, which can lead to several health problems. By providing a balanced and nutritious meal, the program ensures that children stay healthy.
                Social welfare: The mid-day meal program also promotes social welfare by
                reducing hunger and poverty. It also helps in reducing child labour by encouraging parents to send their children to school. In summary, the mid-day meal program is an important initiative that provides nutrition, education, health, and social welfare benefits to children in our school.</p>
